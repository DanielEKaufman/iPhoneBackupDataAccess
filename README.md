iPhoneBackupDataAccess
======================
So far I have built one class to access contact data and another the access messaging data (text and iMessaging).  My original intent was to examine the frequency of messages sent to specific individuals and see how they compared.  The current implementation creates a CSV file which can easily be used to create a simple visualization.  This is an alpha version, and I plan to make updates as I get around to them.
